            <p>I'm currently working as a Sr. JavaScript Engineer at Directi, Mumbai. I've been in the web development field for more than 5 years. I love what I do. It's amazing.</p>
            <p>I started my career teaching web design at an art/design school back in 2009. Other than programming with JavaScript I love to read NodeJs, Relativity Time and books about the power of the subconscious mind. I also try to live as a concerned citizen. On weekends, you'll probably find me biking down a mountain, taking it easy.</p>
            <p>I just followed my dream and have learned most of what I know from the best teacher there is - life. Over the years I have worked at various organizations related to web development that helped me grow my knowledge further.</p>
            
            <p>You can view my courses on Udemy, @Udemy I teach you in the most entertaining and interactive way possible. My objective is to keep my students happy with what they are learning, because, you learn the most only when you enjoy it. </br>
